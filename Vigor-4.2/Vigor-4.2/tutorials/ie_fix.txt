To fix the chart.js issues with IE.

1) Open the ".js" and copy the code into http://jscompress.com/

2) Compress the js.

3) Copy and save the minified js back into the corresponding js file.



REASON:  IE has an issue, go figure, that does not properly render .js spacing.  Minifying solves the issue.
